# Unit 1: Introduction to Python 3

This unit will introduce you to the Python 3 programming language and cover how to use a platform-independent web-based programming environment to begin writing basic Python scripts. 
We will introduce basic Python data types, the assignment operator, and how to output data to the screen.

 ## History of Python

**Late 1980s: The Birth of Python**
- Python was conceived by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.
- Guido van Rossum started working on the implementation of Python at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands in December 1989.
- The language's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java.

**Early 1990s: Python 1.0 and Open Source Release**
- Python 1.0 was released in January 1994. It included many of the features that are still present in the language today.
- Guido van Rossum released Python's source code to the public, making it an open-source project. This decision played a significant role in the language's adoption and community-driven development.

**2000s: Python 2.x and 3.x Transition**
- Python 2.0 was released in 2000, and subsequent versions in the 2.x series were developed and widely used.
- In 2008, Python 3.0 (also known as "Python 3000" and "Py3k") was released with a focus on fixing and enhancing the design of the language. However, due to backward compatibility issues, the adoption of Python 3.x was gradual.

**2010s: Growth, Popularity, and Python 3 Adoption**
- During the 2010s, Python saw tremendous growth in popularity, driven by its versatility, readability, and a vibrant ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
- The community actively worked on the adoption of Python 3, addressing compatibility issues and encouraging developers to migrate from Python 2 to Python 3.
- The end of official support for Python 2 occurred on January 1, 2020, marking a complete transition to Python 3.

**2020s: Continued Growth and Development**
- Python continues to be one of the most popular programming languages, widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.
- The Python Software Foundation (PSF) oversees the development of Python and supports the language's community and infrastructure.

Throughout its history, Python has evolved into a powerful and versatile programming language, known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive standard library. The language's community-driven development model and open-source nature have played crucial roles in its success and widespread adoption.
