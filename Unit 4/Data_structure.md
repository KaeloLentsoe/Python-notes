# Unit 4: Data Structures I â€“ Lists and Strings

- In this unit, we explore how data is structured within Python so we can program efficiently. 

- Specifically, you will be introduced to lists and also immersed more deeply in the subject of strings. Upcoming units will introduce even more powerful data structures.

# 4.1 Python Lists
## Creating Lists

Definition of a list: 
**"A list is a data structure capable of storing different types of data."**

In Python, **a list is a built-in data structure that allows you to store and organize a collection of items.** Lists are mutable, which means you can change their elements by adding, removing, or modifying items. Lists are defined by enclosing the elements in square brackets `[]` and separating them with commas.

Here's the basic syntax for creating a list in Python:

```python
my_list = [element1, element2, element3, ...]
```

- `my_list`: The name of the list.
- `element1`, `element2`, `element3`, ...: The individual elements of the list. These can be of any data type, and you can mix different types within the same list.

Here's an example of creating a simple list:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
```

In this example, the list `fruits` contains strings representing different types of fruits.

Lists in Python are versatile and can be used for various purposes, such as storing collections of numbers, strings, or even other lists. They are commonly used for tasks like iteration, data manipulation, and storage of heterogeneous data.
